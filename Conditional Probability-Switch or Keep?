Four identical sealed envelopes are on a table. One contains a $100 bill. 
You select an envelope at random and hold it in your hand without opening it. 
Two of the three remaining envelopes are then removed and set aside, still sealed. 
You are told that they are empty. 
You are not given the choice of keeping the envelope you selected or exchanging it for the one on the table. 
What should you do? A) Keep your envelope; B) switch it; or C) it doesn't matter.
n<-100000
keep<-c()
switch<-c()
for (i in 1:n){
  envelope<-shuffle(c(1,0,0,0))
  random<-sample(1:4,1,replace=T) #select an index and hold your envelope
  selection<-envelope[random]
  remaining<-envelope[-random] #take out the envolope selected
  remaining
  last_envelope<-c()
  for (i in 1:3){
    if (remaining[i]==1){
      last_envelope<-1
    }
  }
  if (is.null(last_envelope)){
    last_envelope<-0
  }
  switch<-append(switch,last_envelope)
  keep<-append(keep,selection)
}
